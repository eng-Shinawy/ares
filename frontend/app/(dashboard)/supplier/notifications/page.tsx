/**
 * Supplier Notifications — placeholder.
 *
 * The backend endpoints for the supplier notifications module are
 * implemented and ownership-scoped:
 *
 *   - GET  /api/supplier/notifications              (paginated, filterable)
 *   - GET  /api/supplier/notifications/unread-count (topbar badge)
 *   - PUT  /api/supplier/notifications/{id}/read    (mark one as read)
 *   - PUT  /api/supplier/notifications/read-all     (mark all as read)
 *
 * This page intentionally renders only a title. The dropdown, list,
 * empty-state, and deep-link click handling will be implemented in a
 * follow-up iteration. See `./README.md` for the planned UX, payload
 * shapes, business rules and security model.
